♻️ IMPACT
Environmental Footprint:
    •    –75% lower carbon emissions vs. power-loom production
    •    0% synthetic dye runoff or chemical mordants
    •    100% biodegradable cotton and plant pigments
    •    1 liter of toxic wastewater prevented per garment
    •    50 + artisans supported through seasonal hand production
Story:
Natural indigo (Indigofera tinctoria) is revived through a living fermentation vat fed with lime and jaggery.
Artisans dye and print by hand, letting oxidation — not machines — bring the blue to life.
Each print emerges as a fingerprint of air, light, and patience.
🌿 Dyed by breath and time, not industry.

🧺 CARE
    •    Hand-wash separately in cold water with pH-neutral soap
    •    Avoid direct sunlight when drying to protect indigo tones
    •    Do not bleach or soak for long periods
    •    Iron on low heat while slightly damp
    •    Expect soft fading — proof of a living dye
✳️ Your blue will mature like denim — personal, alive, and ever-changing.

🪶 CULTURE
💙 The Meaning of Sonali
Sonali (सोनाली) means golden, radiant, or sun-kissed in Sanskrit and Hindi.
It evokes the warm glow of dawn — the moment when light meets blue sky.
In this romper, “Sonali” is the golden spirit within indigo: optimism woven through tranquility.
“Blue holds the sky; Sonali brings the sun.”

🩵 Design Lineage: Salwar Reimagined
Inspired by the North Indian salwar, whose pleated ease and freedom defined centuries of movement,
the Blue Sonali Romper translates that heritage into a modern form — a single flowing silhouette that merges structure and softness.
It honors craft and innovation equally, allowing the body to breathe in geometry and grace.
“Heritage in motion — a salwar reborn as play.”
⸻
🌾 Artisan Rhythm & Seasonal Life
In Jaipur’s textile villages like Bagru and Sanganer, life moves to a different tempo.
Printing days follow the sun, and work slows during the monsoon, Navratri, and Diwali — times reserved for family, worship, and renewal.
This pause isn’t a break from work but a continuation of culture — proof that craft is cyclical, like nature itself.
“They rest when the gods rest; their hands resume when the light returns.”
Fashion made in harmony with seasons, not schedules.
⸻
✨ REFLECTION
The Blue Sonali Romper is an ode to freedom — of movement, of craft, of self.
It bridges the ancient and the present: where blue meets gold, and where slow work meets modern design.
“Stillness creates shape; light gives it life.”
“She moves in indigo, radiating Sonali gold within.”
