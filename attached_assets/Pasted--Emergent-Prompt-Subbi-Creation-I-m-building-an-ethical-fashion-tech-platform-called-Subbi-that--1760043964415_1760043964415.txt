🌿 Emergent Prompt: Subbi Creation
I’m building an ethical fashion-tech platform called Subbi that bridges culture, sustainability, and technology. Please generate the full MVP setup, UX, and database architecture for a digital garment passport system that uses NFC tags or QR codes to verify authenticity, trace supply chains, and unlock storytelling experiences.
Core Description:
Subbi connects global artisans and conscious consumers through garments that each carry a unique stamp that can be unlocked in a digital passport system in app or website. When tapped or scanned, the tag reveals the garment’s origin, craft lineage, environmental footprint, and unlockable mixed-media storytelling (music, recipes, videos, poetry, maps, etc.).
Key Features to Include:
	•	Brand Dashboard (B2B): Brands can onboard their collections, upload garment data, artisan stories, media, and impact metrics.
	•	Consumer Experience (B2C): Each garment’s passport includes three sections — Impact, Care, and Culture.
	•	Stamps & Badges System: Each garment unlocks collectible stamps that track personal cultural and environmental impact.
	•	User Accounts: Optional for MVP but should support Google login and membership tiers (Gold/Silver/Platinum).
	•	Database: Should connect garments, artisans, materials, media, and user interactions (unlocks, stamps, etc.).
	•	NFC/QR Integration: Simple database entry linking each NFC tag’s UID to its garment passport entry.
	•	Admin Controls: Verification for artisan and brand authenticity.
	•	Storytelling AI Integration: Use GPT-5 or another LLM to assist with generating and curating cultural content (craft histories, myths, origin stories).
	•	UI/UX Style: Elegant, minimal, travel-inspired — like Vogue x National Geographic. Include editorial fonts, stamp visuals, and soft scrapbook-like textures.
	•	Optional Add-ons:
	•	Cultural map interface showing artisan regions
	•	Analytics dashboard for tracking environmental footprint and engagement
	•	Gamified user passport (Spotify-wrapped-style impact recap)
Goal: Build a vertically integrated system that can scale into a marketplace for 1,500+ ethical artisan brands. The MVP should include a consumer passport demo and a brand onboarding flow.

UI FLOW:
Home page: 
Spotlight on clickable links (one that is for recent sustainable fashion news story, one that is a stamp preview -could be any of the elements in a stamp, one garment in a collection on our site, a collection)
A sidebar to navigate to other screens like my passport / shop / about us 
The shop:
users can browse through all the garments/brands that have partnered with Subbi (potentially have a brands section and all garments section and we sort/search/filter through popular garments section, or new collections etc)
Each garment holds a preview of the stamp features (the first paragraph of an article/story, the origin of the garment, the name of the food/beauty recipe, the first few seconds or still of the video)
My passport:
A profile section for logged in users to hold all user information (i.e name, shipping addresses, payment methods, purchases, badges earned) 
Each individual purchase unlocks a stamp. i.e each garment will have a stamp that they will hold:
Environmental impact (water saved, co2 saved, artisans uplifted)
Care instructions of the garment
Cultural digital archive (3-4 curated mixed media elements to reflect the culture of the hands that made the clothes)
Local myths and legends
Vocabulary with definitions from the dialect
Demonstrations of the craft
History/geography/origin of the crafts
Traditions 
Artisan interview
Local music recording 
Food recipe
Badges for milestones (that measure cumulative impact, unlocked when milestones are reached for consumers and brands)
Ex. cultural archivist : 5+ garment stamps from different communities (celebrates cross culture curiosity)
Ex. soil saver : 1000+ liters of water saved
Ex. Natural dye : 5 garments purchased that use natural dye instead of chemical
Ex. Ancestral ally : supporting 3+ endangered artisan communities 
Ex. Textile time traveler : (unlocking 5+ weaving techniques)
